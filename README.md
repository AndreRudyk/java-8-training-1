# Intro
Java 8 training exercises made with love for my team mates

# How to do the exercises
Clone this repository, open it with your favourite IDE and implement all the methods from Lambdas, Stream and Optionals classes while passing the unit tests.

# Retrospective
It would be useful to do a retrospective meeting among the co-workers who have done the exercises to discuss the proposed solutions.
